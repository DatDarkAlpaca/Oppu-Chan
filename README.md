# Oppu-Chan
Oppu-Chan is a simple application for training katakana and hiragana through repetition built with Tkinter.

## Getting Started
Since Oppu-Chan uses Tkinter, running this application is a breeze. Ensure that you're using the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You'll also need to install [ttkthemes](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html) in order to run the program.

```
git clone https://github.com/DatDarkAlpaca/Oppu-Chan
cd Oppu-Chan
pip install -r requirements.txt
