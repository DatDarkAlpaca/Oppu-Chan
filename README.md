# Oppu-Chan
Oppu-Chan is a simple application for training katakana and hiragana through repetition built with Tkinter.

## Getting Started
Since Oppu-Chan uses Tkinter, running this application is a breeze. Ensure that you're using the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

There are no additional dependencies, so you can run it directly using the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/DatDarkAlpaca/Oppu-Chan
cd Oppu-Chan
py oppu.py
```
